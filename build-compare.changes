- fix 2 bugs
- don't ignore source rpms - changed sources should output 
  changed source rpms, no matter if they create the same binaries
  (think of changed copyright header in spec files)

- Create initial package based on the work of Matz and Coolo
  This package provides script for the main build script to be able
  to check if a new build has the same result than the former one.
  The Build Service is able to skip the new build than.
- changes in source rpms are currently ignored, is that okay ?
